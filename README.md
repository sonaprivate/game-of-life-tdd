Developing game of life project using test driven development approach

# Final result after testing Cell class
We followed rules based on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
<br>
After completing each rule for **Cell** class we wrote methods for testing depicted below
<br>
We followed **Red Green Refactor** pattern while testing our project

# Final result after testing CoordinateTest class
<br>
By following the rules we wrote test cases for testing coordinates, there includes
<br>
- Get neighbors for the first cell <br>
- Get neighbors for the last cell <br>
- Get neighbors for any other cells <br>
